# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning


## Project Goals
Apply supervised learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements.

## Process
1. Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing
-  Import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables
-  Handle missing values and outliers
-  Perform feature engineering as needed
2. Three machine learning models
-  Logistic Regression
-  Decision Tree
-  Random Forest

## Results
-  SkinThickness, Insulin column around 1/3 values are missing, and Insulin has many outliers.
-  Glucose has the highest correlation of disbetes outcome. Also, age, BMI and pregnancy play important roles.
-  After Scaling the features, the model performance has improved.
-  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest were developed as predictive models for diabetes outcome. Random forest Model performance is the best among three models.
